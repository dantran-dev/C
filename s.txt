The Stack Abstract Data type is used to model the collection of sales for each of the countries. As we have the number of sales need to be added to the end of the list when number of sale larger than zero, whereas the Stack ADT supports adding node in front, adding node in the middle, and adding the node in the end. As the requirements from the assignment, the Stack ADT is used for that purpose.
